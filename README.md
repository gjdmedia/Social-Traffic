# socialTraffic
Source Code for the Social Traffic project developed for MRes Digital Art & Technology

The purpose of this project is to produce a proof of concept iOS mobile app designed to capture, visualise and share data relating to locations of driver stress. The app allows users to share and view locations where accidents or incidents of road rage have taken place, allowing for a collective highlighting and mapping of trouble areas. Drawing upon a variety of sources including social media, public data feeds, users biological data and information captured through a network of users, the app will build a picture that both informs of current conditions and also visualises regular patterns of behaviour. The app will attempt to combine aspects of quantitative data captured through sensory means with qualitative data that can be drawn from social media feeds within the immediate vicinity.
